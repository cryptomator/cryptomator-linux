cryptomator-linux
=================

This repository is one of the [Cryptomator](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator) build pipelines.
It contains resources and CI scripts to automatically download a prereleased buildkit from the main project page and create an executable [AppImage](https://appimage.org/).

To build your own AppImage, look at the [CI script](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-linux/blob/master/.github/workflows/appimage.yml) or use the local build script removed in commit [68ca73](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-linux/commit/68ca7311acac1cf006e2c25b202e2def92ae8595).
